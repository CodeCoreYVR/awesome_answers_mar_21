  # GET "/questions/new" - A form to create a new question
  #3. create: POST "/<resources>" - handle the submission to the "new form"
  #POST "/questions" - insert a new question into the database
  #4. show: GET "/<resources>/:id" - return one record of that resource
  #GET "/questions/1" - return the show page for question with id of 1
  #5. edit: GET "/<resources>/:id/edit" - returns a view form to update an existing resource
  #GET "/questions/1/edit" - return a form to edit the question with id 1
  #6. update: PATCH "/<resources>/:id" - handle the submission of the "edit form"
  #PATCH "/questions/1" - update the question with id of 1
  #7. destroy: DELETE "/<resources>/:id" - delete a record from the database
  #DELETE "/questions/1" - delete the question with id 1
